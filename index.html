    <h1> My personnal page </h1>

<p> My name is <span class="shawn"> <b>Shawn</b></span>, I was 20 years old and I was born in Lyon. </p>
<u>I have two passions: </u>
<ul> 
  <li> The first one is the foot that I practiced during 8 years </li> 
  <li>The second one is to have good time with my friends.</li> 
</ul> 
</p>

<p> ⚽️ Football competence: The prerequisites ⚽️ </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <b>First prerequisite: </b> ability</li>
  <p>The player must have acquired the necessary skill (kicking, ball control,...) to build and execute an activity configuration that will produce the desired consequences. For example, to succeed in a penalty shootout surrounded by opponents, to control the ball in a race, etc.
<br>
<br>
 The achievements of a skill include:
<ul><il>
  - <b>Intellectual</b> and physical knowledge, (theoretical knowledge of gestures). the player must know how to carry out a gesture an action which are the elements that promote or hinder the action.</il>
<br>
<il>
  - <b>Knowledge of learning strategies </b> that facilitate the functions of information processing and memory, i.e. having sufficient intelligence.
</il>
<br>
<il>
 - The <b>processes of attention </b>and activation of consciousness, (motivation)
</il>
<br>
<il>
- The <b>activation processes </b> of the activity,
</il>
<br>
<il>
-<b>Performance monitoring </b>and evaluation knowledge (feedback). The player must know how to evaluate himself and his performance.</il></ul></p>
  
  <li><b>Second prerequisite:</b>  the feeling of being skillful</li>
<p>The player must have developed not only the intellectual and motor skills necessary to accomplish the task, but also the feeling of being skillful; a player's perception of his own effectiveness in the field of <b>Physical and Sports Activities</b> (the feeling of being "effective" or "being able to achieve such and such a performance") is fundamental to optimal motivation and learning during training. For being competent in a particular field requires not only that the practitioner has at his disposal a real ability in the field concerned but also that he knows how to recognize that he has this ability and believes that it is important in the very process of defining himself.
<br>
  
<br>
The implementation of the competency requires, at a minimum, the awareness that one really possesses the required skills. It is this awareness that is generally described as the feeling of competence or perceived competence, in other words the feeling of competence is an essential aspect of actual competence. Without an explicit awareness of <b>the possession of a given skill,</b> its manifestation will probably be fortuitous and not subject to systematic self-regulation. </p>

  <li><b>Third prerequisite: </b> optimal motivation</li>
  
<p>The player must have the optimal motivation to trigger and maintain his investment until the goal directing his learning activity is reached.
<br>
<br>
  <u>The motivation for choice</u>
<br>
<br>
An important factor in success is the degree of personal investment in prescribed tasks. Self-confidence, purpose and anxiety are predictive of this investment. The motivation for choice takes place until the moment the intention to learn is established. It therefore covers the processes of goal setting, self-efficacy assessments and goal importance.
<br>
<br>
  <u>Executive motivation or volition </u>
<br>
<br>

Executive motivation or volition is related to the control of the action implemented. It concerns the processes involved in maintaining an intention or goal until it is achieved and differs from the motivation of choice which concerns only the processes involved in the initial creation of an intention or goal. </p>
  
  <li><b>Fourth prerequisite:</b>  emotion management</li>
  
  <p> <b>A player must be able to manage his emotions: <u>The coping</u></b>
<br>
<br>   
Coping refers to the ability to cope with emotions, especially stress. It is a set of strategies by which a player manages the emotions that arise from a task that is very demanding for him and threatening to his self-esteem. </p>
  
  <li><b>Fifth prerequisite: </b> biological aspects</li>
  
<p>The player's structure and biological functioning must be able to support the implementation of the components of motivation and ability.</p>
  
  
<li><b>Sixth prerequisite:</b>  the environment</li>
  
<p>The player must have the cooperation of an environment that will facilitate or at least not hinder progress towards the goal. In other words, the environment <i>(family, coach, living conditions, etc.) </i>must be consistent with the player's personal goals, cognitive, biological and transactional abilities; it must provide the material and informational resources necessary to facilitate the achievement of the goal and provide an emotional climate that supports and facilitates effective functioning.</p>
